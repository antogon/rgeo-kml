At its core is an implementation of the\r\nindustry standard OGC Simple Features Specification, which provides data\r\nrepresentations of geometric objects such as points, lines, and polygons,\r\nalong with a set of geometric analysis operations. See the README for the\r\n\"rgeo\" gem for more information.\r\n\r\nRGeo::Kml is an optional \\RGeo add-on module that provides Kml\r\nencoding and decoding services. Kml is a format\r\nused by many web services that need to communicate geospatial data. See\r\nhttps://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/ for more information.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n-------------\r\nRGeo::Kml has the following requirements:\r\n\r\n* Ruby 1.9.2 or later.\r\n* rgeo 0.3.13 or later.\r\n\r\nInstall RGeo::Kml as a gem:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n gem install rgeo\r\n gem install rgeo-kml\r\n ```\r\n \r\nSee the README for the \"rgeo\" gem, a required dependency, for further\r\ninstallation information.\r\n\r\nDevelopment and support\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nMore information can be found on the [project website on GitHub](http://github.com/ldonnet/rgeo-kml). \r\nThere is extensive usage documentation available [on the wiki](https://github.com/ldonnet/rgeo-kml/wiki).\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n--------\r\n\r\n### Decode KML\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire 'rgeo/kml'\r\nstr1 = '{\"type\":\"Point\",\"coordinates\":[1,2]}'\r\ngeom = RGeo::Kml.decode(str1, :json_parser => :json)\r\ngeom.as_text              # => \"POINT(1.0 2.0)\"\r\nstr2 = '{\"type\":\"Feature\",\"geometry\":{\"type\":\"Point\",\"coordinates\":[2.5,4.0]},\"properties\":{\"color\":\"red\"}}'\r\nfeature = RGeo::Kml.decode(str2, :json_parser => :json)\r\nfeature['color']          # => 'red'\r\nfeature.geometry.as_text  # => \"POINT(2.5 4.0)\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Encode in KML\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nhash = RGeo::Kml.encode(feature)\r\nhash.to_json == str2      # => true\r\n```\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n \r\nThis project is licensed under the MIT license, a copy of which can be found in the LICENSE file.\r\n\r\nSupport\r\n-------\r\n \r\nUsers looking for support should file an issue on the GitHub issue tracking page (https://github.com/ldonnet/rgeo-kml/issues), or file a pull request (https://github.com/ldonnet/rgeo-kml/pulls) if you have a fix available.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
